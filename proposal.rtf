My app is a guide for Valorant players, a tactical shooter from Riot Games. 
It describes arrow lineups for the character Sova on every map of the game (Bind, Ascent, Haven, Icebox, Split). 
So the app will have a table view controller to first choose 
the cell corresponding to a map and then a table of all the lineups of the map from easiest to hardest.
